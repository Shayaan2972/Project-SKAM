Idea: Meal Generator
Process: You input a set of ingredients that you have into the application. The application will then feed it through OpenAI's GPT API with a prebuilt prompt using the ingredients you have. It will then return a response based on the level of difficulty of cooking that meal with said ingredients. The application will display the meals in a card format, and when clicked on, will give you more resources to websites or YouTube videos on how to create that meal.
Technologies: Likely HTML, CSS, JS or a similar stack. GPT API.
