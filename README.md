Idea: Meal Generator <br />
Process: You input a set of ingredients that you have into the application. The application will then feed it through OpenAI's GPT API with a prebuilt prompt using the ingredients you have. It will then return a response with multiple meals and display them based on the level of difficulty of cooking that meal with said ingredients. The application will display the meals in a card format, and when clicked on, will give you more resources to websites or YouTube videos on how to create that meal. Maybe we can add more parameters such as what type of cuisine or kitchen tools you'll need (baking, frying, etc) <br />
Technologies: Likely HTML, CSS, JS, or React for component-based developing. GPT API.
